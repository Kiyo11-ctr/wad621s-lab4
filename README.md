   # WAD621S – Lab 4: Registration → Profile Cards & Summary

This is a small, plain HTML/CSS/JS project. The form collects student details and, on submit, creates:
- a profile card, and
- a matching row in the summary table.

The Remove button deletes the student from both places. No frameworks or build tools.

## How to run
1) Download or clone the repo.
2) Open `index.html` in a browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox).
   - You can also use VS Code Live Server if you want auto-reload.

## Files
- `index.html` – form, cards, summary table
- `style.css` – simple styling (purple primary button, red remove button)
- `script.js` – add/remove logic, keeps card and table in sync

## Notes
- Required fields use the browser’s built-in validation.
- Photo URL is optional. Use a direct image link; if it fails, a placeholder is shown.
